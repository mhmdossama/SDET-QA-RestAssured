### Chaining in RestAssured


* Chaining is a powerful feature in RestAssured that allows you to combine multiple method calls into a single line of code.
* This approach improves the readability and conciseness of your tests.
*
* Below is an example of a typical workflow using chaining:
*
* 1. Login and retrieve user credentials.
* 2. Create a new user.
* 3. Update the user's details.
* 4. Delete the user.
*
* Each step can be executed in a single chain of method calls, making the code more streamlined and easier to follow.
