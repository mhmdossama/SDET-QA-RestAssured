What is Path parameters and Query parameters?

Path parameters are used to identify a specific resource in the URL path.
They are part of the URL and are typically used to specify a unique identifier for a resource.
For example, in the URL `https://api.example.com/users/123`, `123` is a path parameter that identifies a specific user.

Query parameters are used to filter or modify the response of an API request.
They are appended to the URL after a question mark (`?`),
and are typically used to specify optional parameters for the request.
For example, in the URL `https://api.example.com/users?age=25&sort=asc`, `age` and `sort` are query parameters
 that filter the results based on age and sort order.
